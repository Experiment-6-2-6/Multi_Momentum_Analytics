# Multi_Momentum_Analytics
It was intended as a help in my personal investing strategy because I have to do a lot of manual checking and calculations every week for my private retirement portfolio.
The idea is very loosely based on the "Dual Momentum" strategy by Gary Antonacci.
This project is my first real work in R and summarises my learning about R, SQL, data analytics and version control.
The work was never intended as any investing advice/device.
It is purely practical exercise (one can call it a capestone) in data analytics using R, hence no guarantee is given and I strongly discourage the use of it in investing.
To make any reasonable use of it you would need to understand the idea and it is only in my head so far.
Probably at the end of the project I will do some simulation and backtesting to check if it is even profitable.
But I donâ€™t know it yet. Well I know it but I haven't proved it scientifically yet. ðŸ˜€
Anyway it is going to be an interesting adventure with R and real data analysis in practice.
Aloha!
