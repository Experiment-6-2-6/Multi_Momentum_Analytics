# Introduction
The mine goal of this work is an automation of all weekly tasks associated with managing my investment portfolio. 

## Setting Up The Environment

I am going to use two packages:
* Quantmod
* Tidyverse
My ETFs' data are from Yahoo Finance and that is already included in Quantmod.
```{r}
install.packages("quantmod")
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(quantmod)
library(tidyverse)
```
